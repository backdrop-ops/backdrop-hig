# Conceptual Model

### Concept
The fundamental aspect for interfacing with user is the conceptual model or mental model. Depicting or establishing the
 relationships between the interface elements and real world objects are important.
The purpose of the conceptual model or mental model is to establish the past experience of the user with
the interface elements, so that it helps user to relate with the interface and its elements naturally and intuitively.
It should also help user to operate in more predictive way.

### The Goal
The Gaol for effective mental model or conceptual model is to identify the set of users, the objective and how it will reach the goal.
The key steps to identify and proceed are as follows:

* FOR - Target audience
* WHY - Problem it solves
* THE - Solution
* IS A - Type of solution e.g. modules, themes etc
* THAT - Key benefits
* UNLIKE - Related or pre-existing solutions
* OUR SOLUTION - Why better than others

### Persona
Persona helps identify the target audience/users of the solution and establishes a common understanding among the design
 and development team. A persona is the representation of an user.
Persona describe the target users, describing how they're likely to use the solution, and what theyâ€™ll expect from it.


### User Stories
User stories are nothing but scenarios by which it is understood how user will operate/use the solution  and achieve the
goal in the context as described in this scenario.
