# Constraint Input

### Pattern Description
When system expects input data from user in specific format, type or syntax but user have not much clear idea about it. Then it is suggested to use constraint input with pre-defined data.
The goal of this pattern is to help user choose from the pre-defined options to provide inputs.

### Problem Statement
When user needs to enter data to the system but have no clear idea what to put and in what format and expected correct format.
And system has assumptions of the correct form of data and without which unable to function in proper way.

### Use When
System needs a sanitized and pre-defined form of data and  as per the requirement of the system to function properly. And user has not clear idea about  how to provide correct data as input.

### Solution
Provide options with system acceptable data to the user so that user could not able to enter beyond the pre-defined input data.
