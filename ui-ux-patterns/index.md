# UI /UX Patterns

> ...a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then de- scribes the core of the solution to that problem...

We at backdrop try to document the *Interaction design patterns* which are a way to describe solutions to common usability or accessibility problems in a specific context and used in backdrop core. They document interaction models that make it easier for users to understand an interface and accomplish their tasks or goal.


# Elements of an interaction design pattern

We at backdrop organize the common elements to describe the UI/ UX patterns with the following elements:

* **Pattern Name** - Choosing a clear and descriptive name helps people find the pattern and encourages clear communication between team members during design discussions.

* **Pattern Description** -  Because short names like "one-window drilldown" are sometimes not sufficient to describe the pattern, a few additional lines of explanation (or a canonical screenshot) will help explain how the pattern works.

* **Problem Statement** -  Written in user-centered language, this communicates what the user wants to achieve or what the challenge is to the end-user.

* **Use When** -  "Context of use" is a critical component of the design pattern. This element helps people understand situations when the design pattern applies (and when it does not.)

* **Solution** -  The solution should explain "how" to solve the problem, and may include prescriptive checklists, screenshots, or even short videos demonstrating the pattern in action.

* **Rationale** -  Providing reasons "why" the pattern works will reinforce the solution, though time-pressed developers may prefer to ignore this explanation.

* **Examples** - Each example shows how the pattern has been successfully applied This is often accompanied by a screenshot and a short description.

# Categorization

We at backdrop categorized the patterns used throughout the backdrop as follows:

* **User Input**
* **Playing with Data**
